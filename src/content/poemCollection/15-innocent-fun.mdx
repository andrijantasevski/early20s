title: "Innocent Fun"
---

We take a trip,

And do what tourists do.

We walk around,

Try this, try that.

Of course, our feet get tired too.

We look at some buildings, the city.

Yes, they are beautiful.

Now, if you think I invited you to take a trip

with me

To do what tourists do,

To walk around like tourists do,

To try this and that like tourists do,

And to get sore feet,

You're a fool.

For I invited you to take a trip to me, my

land and my beach.

What I really want to say is,

I love formalities.
