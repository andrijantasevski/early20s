I miss you

Especially at 2:37am

And every other second

When I'm not with you

I miss you

When I realize that your head

Isn't on my chest and I have the bed

All to myself

I miss you

Not only when you leave

But when you are here

And please kiss me slap me

Bite me yell at me because you're

A present of the present

And you know I'm not a fan of birthdays

But I think I want to change.
