title: "Sundays"

When errands were adventures

And a Sunday trip to the store

Was our cheap Paris trip

And I could be myself

Because I had nothing to prove to you

Your short stories

Like the time your grandma

Gave your duck away

And everyone staring at my

Hysterical laughing

Because I just whispered in your ear

How much I need to pee

Now you are laughing too

I am peeing

You are putting on your red lipstick

I know that you love to claim things

By leaving lipstick marks on them

I tell you thinking you forgot it

You put your lipstick on in a lovely way

You tell me to look away

Because you are losing focus

Your wool socks

I'd love to take them off

And give you the foot massage of your life

You are putting on your brown boots

Or the black ones

I don't remember

But I love them both

I love the noise your steps make

In the snow

The odor of salep

Far inferior to yours

Even though I can't smell it

Right now

Just like you.
