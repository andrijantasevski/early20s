title: "Anxiety-Relieving Blue"
---

Broad day light

And you're intimate

As ever.

I am counting your steps

Because I want our walk to be endless.

The ever-changing skies are tinted with

An anxiety-relieving blue.

Lean on my crescent-shaped body.

Let me embrace you and let us

Soar down the clouds

Like two bird lovers

Now entangled.
