I wonder

Why you appear

Everywhere

Especially in the background

Of movies

In the form of Dos Equis

Or

On every fifth shirt

A girl wears

In the shape of a pineapple.

Your godforsaken town

How is it getting

So much

Traction

And why are there

So many surf shops

In Central Europe

I enter

Yell

And they think I'm a fool

But

As always

You laugh from the corner

With your beautiful crooked

Teeth
