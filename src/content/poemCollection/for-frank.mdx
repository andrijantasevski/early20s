title: "For Frank"

Don't think you can get rid of me

For I am always right

Next to you

I am the summer rain

That ruins your day

But you live in Texas

So it's not like it rains often

I am the morning sun

Peeking through your bilnds

So it's not like you are the first one I wake up

I see Frank O'Hara first.
