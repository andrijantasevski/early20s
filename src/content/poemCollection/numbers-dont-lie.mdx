title: "Numbers Don't Lie"
---

It's a comforting thought

Knowing that we are both under the

Same sun

Knowing that you'll get tanned this summer

Under our sun

Knowing that we both share the same moon

I'm sorry that I see it earlier than you

It's a horrible thought

When I realize we don't share the same

Clouds and their rain drops and their lightnings

I miss storms and I miss you a bit more

I'd go with 5%, but it turns out that numbers do

lie
